# Goodness-of-Fit-for-Spatial-Point-Process-Models
This dissertation explores methods for assessing the goodness-of-fit (GOF) of spatial point process models, with a focus on Log-Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCPs). Using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) for simulations, it evaluates several GOF measuresâ€”such as Pearson residuals, the Pair Correlation Function (PCF), the K-function, and global metrics like DIC and WAICâ€”under clustered and non-clustered spatial patterns. The study highlights both the strengths and limitations of these measures, particularly in capturing multi-scale clustering and localized spatial dependencies.
